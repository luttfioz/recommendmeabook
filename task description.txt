Task for candidate.
JS Engineer Tech Challenge

The purpose of this exercise is to serve as a basis for the discussion in the tech interview. We ask you to implement a
simple application or a script to do the following.
User story
Our customer loves buying books, but has terrible difficulty deciding which books to purchase. You want to help by
writing an application or a script that:
1. Will ask the user to select their preferred genre
2. Will fetch a random book for the selected genre from
https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2020
3. Will then open a browser (Chrome for example), and
a. open Amazon.com
b. find the selected book on Amazon
c. add that book to the cart
d. display the checkout page

Now, the user just has to confirm the purchase and soon they will get to enjoy a new book to read!
Deliverables
A valid solution can be provided either as a .ZIP file, link to a git repository, or by simply attaching source code files to
an email. Your solution should be runnable. Feel free to include any notes or documentation in a README file.
Weâ€™re not expecting you to rely on service APIs but rather use browser manipulation tools like Puppeteer or similar to
scrape the required data.
The use of TypeScript is encouraged but not mandatory, feel free to write simple and clean JavaScript if you want.
